# 💻 Digital Platforms Assignments 📚

Hello! I’m Ковалёв В. Я. from group 24940 ИИР, and this repository contains my work on **Digital Platforms**. Dive in to explore assembler programming using the Coco dialect and more!

## 📂 Repository Structure

This repository is divided into sections by tasks and contains useful resources for your study.

## 🛠️ How to Use

### Setting Up the Environment
To compile and run the `.asm` files in this repository, you will need to use **CocoIDE**. You can download it from the following GitHub repository:

[CocoIDE GitHub Repository](https://github.com/uh-mickwal/AMES-CocoIDE)

### Compiling and Running Assembly Files
Once you have set up CocoIDE, you can compile and run the `solution.asm` files as follows:

1. Open CocoIDE.
2. Load the `.asm` file you wish to compile.
3. Use the IDE to assemble and run the program.

### Navigating the Repository
The tasks are organized under `1_sem` based on their respective problem sets. Each task folder contains the task description in a `.pdf` file and the solution in an `.asm` file.

## 📘 Additional Resources

- **Assembler Book (Coco Dialect)**: Refer to `tome.pdf` for an in-depth guide to assembler programming using the Coco dialect.
- **Computer Architecture Book**: `tanenbaum_AC.pdf` contains essential knowledge on computer architecture that complements the assembler tasks.
- **Coco Instruction Set**: The file `instruction-set.pdf` provides a detailed description of the Coco dialect commands.
- **Modified Instruction Set**: My version of the instruction set with clearer explanations can be found in `mod_instruction_set.md`.
